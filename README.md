# OpenStack Workshop

## Content description

This workshop gives an overview over the cloud platform Openstack and introduces
its components.

The most important actions, configurations and use cases are demonstrated through
practical lab exercises.

## Prerequisites

To be able to perform the lab exercises you need a local machine (laptop, etc.)
with an opportunity to connect to a jumphost with SSH which will be provided during
this workshop.
The SSH connection is secured with public key authentication so you can use an existing
SSH keypair or optionally create one during the workshop.
